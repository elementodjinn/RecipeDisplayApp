### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
Attached is a screen shot. It's a very simple application that displays every recipe with its cuisine and a picture. ![Screen Shot 2025-03-05 at 11 47 10 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af799ca4-9cd8-4fc5-950c-372d969a5c60)
### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I focused on the caching mostly. I looked through a lot of different implementations, but I wanted to understand the different options. It was a new problem for me, so I wanted to give it its due dilligence.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent 7 hours on this project. Most of it was spent with implementing caching and creating proper unit tests. To create the base loginc and the actual UI was about an hour.
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
This certainly is not the most robust, especially in regards to the caching in particular. I traded off long term usefulness and ability to handle large data sets performantly for simplicity. Finally, the UI isn't the best. I wanted to focus on the functionality, so I put less care into the actual look.
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think it's either the refresh functionality or the caching. I wasn't very used to either of those functions, so it's my first time implementing either. I'm not sure what to look for in terms of implementation, so I looked into it, but had to play it by ear.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
